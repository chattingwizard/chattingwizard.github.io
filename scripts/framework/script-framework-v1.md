# Chatting Wizard — Script Strategy & Framework v2

## I. Core Principles

**1. The real-time illusion is sacred.**
Everything the chatter sends must reinforce the belief that the model is there, right now, interacting with this specific sub. Any element that breaks this (perfect messages, repetitive patterns, no references to what the sub says) destroys the sale.

**2. The sub must never feel he's following a script.**
Scripts are for the chatter, not the sub. The sub experiences a real, unpredictable, human conversation. This requires: short varied messages, Reaction Slots, "texture messages" (emojis alone, broken sentences, typos), and pattern-breaking.

**3. Every message has a strategic purpose.**
No filler. Each message does one of: (a) builds rapport, (b) qualifies the sub, (c) increases arousal, (d) prepares the sale, (e) sells, (f) retains. If it doesn't do any, cut it.

**4. The model LEADS, the sub FOLLOWS.**
She never asks permission. Not "can I show you something?" — instead "hold on, let me show you something." She sets the pace, she decides when to escalate, she sends the content. The sub feels pulled by her energy, not sold to.

**5. Sexual energy is the engine. Emotional connection is the fuel.**
The sub pays for sexual excitement. Emotional connection makes it feel REAL and makes the sub COME BACK. But the product is the sexual experience, not the relationship. Never sacrifice sexual energy for an emotional beat during sexting.

## II. Sub Psychology — Why They Spend

| Driver | What it is | How we activate it |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Arousal** | He's horny and wants more content | Explicit sexting + PPV escalation |
| **Ego** | He feels desired, attractive, special | Specific reactions to what HE says/is |
| **Control** | He feels HIS actions cause her reaction | "what you said made me do this" + Reaction Slots |
| **Fantasy** | He believes this could be real | Real-time illusion + credible model personality |
| **Scarcity** | He feels this moment is unique | "I've never done this" (max 2x) + temporal urgency |

---

## III. Psychology Toolkit

### A. Sexual Vulnerability (USE GENEROUSLY)

She "loses control" because of HIM. Feeds ego + control drivers.

**Yes**:
- "you're making me do things I don't normally do"
- "I can't believe I just did that... it's your fault"
- "fuck I didn't plan on going this far but I can't stop"

**No** (emotional vulnerability — microdoses only):
- ~~"nobody talks to me like a real person"~~
- ~~"I feel so lonely here"~~
- ~~"you're the only one who understands me"~~

**Rule**: Emotional vulnerability = ONE throwaway line in rapport ("it's nice talking to someone real for once"). Never during sexting. Never as central theme.

### B. Ego Amplification (3 STRATEGIC MOMENTS)

Not constant. Specific. Earned.

| Moment | How | Example |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **Rapport** | Positive reaction to something sub shared | "wait you ride motorcycles? that's actually really hot" |
| **Pre-PPV** | What sub said/did CAUSED the content | "what you told me made me lose it... I had to record this" |
| **Aftercare** | Reinforce that he's special | "honestly the way you [specific thing] was different" |

**Rule**: Always reference something CONCRETE. Never generic ("you're amazing"). The sub must feel the compliment is unique to him.

### C. Attainability Frame (REAL GIRL WHO CHOOSES YOU)

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "I'm a real girl who finds YOU attractive" | "I'm lonely and you're the only one" |
| "there's something about you specifically" | "nobody ever talks to me" |
| "I chose to show you this" | "I need someone like you" |

She's a real girl, with a real life, who is out of the sub's league but somehow attracted to HIM. He has to "earn" her attention. PPVs are proof he deserves more of her.

### D. Positive Spin (NEVER INSULT THE OPPOSITE GROUP)

When the sub shares something about himself, ALWAYS amplify the positive in a way that's credible for the model's persona.

**Bad**: "I'm tired of [opposite], finally someone like you"
**Good**: Find something genuinely attractive and amplify it

Age examples:
- Sub 45+: "mmm I love older guys... there's something about the confidence 😏"
- Sub 20s: "omg you're around my age? that's so rare here, I feel like we'd actually vibe irl"

**Rule**: Never a flippable template. Always a natural, believable reaction.

### E. Scarcity & Urgency

- "I'm in this mood RIGHT NOW" (temporal — act now or lose it)
- "I've never shown this to anyone" (exclusivity — MAX 2 times per journey)
- "I just recorded this" (unrepeatable — reinforces real-time)

**Rule**: Scarcity is temporal and situational, never artificial. "Only today" sounds like a salesman. "I'm feeling like this right now" sounds real.

## IV. Message Rules

### Length

| Type | Length | Frequency | Example |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Micro | 2-5 words | 20% | "fuck 🥵", "you hard?", "😏😏😏" |
| Short | 1 sentence | 50% | "you're making me feel things rn" |
| Medium | 2 sentences | 25% | "I can't stop thinking about what you said. hold on let me show you" |
| Long | 3+ sentences | 5% (welcome + rare key moments) | Reserved for welcome message only |

### Pattern-breaking

- **Texture messages**: solo emojis, one-word reactions ("omg", "fuck", "wait"), incomplete sentences ("I literally just... no hold on")
- **Structural variation**: not every message ends with emoji. Some without. Some emoji-only.
- **Intentional imperfection**: occasional typos, irregular letter repetition ("fuckkk" but not every message), unfinished thoughts
- **Tonal variation**: not everything is sexual. A random comment, humor, unexpected question breaks predictability

### Explicitness Progression

| Phase | Level | Language |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Rapport | 0/10 | Zero sexual. Casual, friendly, flirty at the end. |
| Teasing Bridge | 3-5/10 | Innuendo, double meaning, "feeling things" |
| Sexting pre-PPV1 | 5-6/10 | "I'm getting wet", "I want to touch myself" |
| Sexting PPV1→PPV2 | 7-8/10 | Oral descriptions, undressing, explicit body references |
| Sexting PPV2→PPV3 | 8-9/10 | Crude language: "fuck my pussy", "your cock", graphic acts |
| Sexting PPV3→PPV4 | 9-10/10 | No filter. Graphic. Orgasm. Raw as possible. |

### Timing Guidelines

| Context | Chatter response time |
|---------|----------------------|
| Rapport | 30-90 seconds |
| Teasing | 20-60 seconds |
| Sexting (between PPVs) | 15-45 seconds (she's more "into it") |
| Pause Points (pre-PPV) | 2-3 minutes (simulates recording) |
| Pause Point (climax PPV) | 1-2 minutes (urgency is high) |

### Autopilot-Safe Rule (MANDATORY)

**Every script message MUST work as-is without any edits from the chatter.** No `[FILL]`, no blanks, no freestyle required. The chatter should be able to send every message by just pressing the button.

**Optional personalization goes in the Note column only.** The message must make sense and sound natural even if the chatter ignores the note completely.

**Note column rules:**
- **Short and clear.** Max 1-2 sentences. No fluff.
- **Direct instructions, not suggestions.** Say "Add his name before 'hi'." NOT "If you can, add his name before 'hi'."
- **Action-oriented.** Tell the chatter exactly WHAT to do: "WAIT 2 MIN", "Send PPV 1 — $10", "Wait for response."
- **No vague language.** No "if you can", "try to", "you might want to". Just tell them what to do.

**Why:** Chatters operate on autopilot. A script that requires creative input will result in errors, broken immersion, or chatters skipping the personalization entirely. Default messages that work out of the box = consistent quality at scale.

**Name personalization:** Use generic terms ("baby", "babe") as default. If the chatter knows the sub's name, they can swap it in — but the script never depends on it.

### Consecutive Message Rule

**Maximum 2 messages in a row without a sub response.** Exception: high-intensity pre-PPV moments. If the chatter sends 3+ messages without the sub responding, it becomes a monologue and the illusion breaks.

## V. The PPV Ladder

| PPV | Content | Price Range | Purpose |
|-----|---------|-------------|---------|
| PPV 0 (Teaser) | Lingerie/clothed, nothing revealed | FREE | Hook visually, create desire |
| PPV 1 | Starting to undress, partial reveal | $5–$15 | Break the buying barrier |
| PPV 2 | More explicit, longer | $20–$35 | Escalate spend |
| PPV 3 | Very explicit | $35–$50 | High-value at peak arousal |
| PPV 4+ | Most explicit, climax | $50+ | Maximum extraction |

### Adaptive Pricing

- Sub bought fast, no hesitation → push to HIGH end of next PPV's range
- Sub took time to buy or seemed hesitant → stay at LOW end
- Sub objected on price → offer 20-30% discount ONE TIME, then hold firm
- Never discount PPV 0 (it's already free)

---

## VI. Customer Segments

### Segment A: New Subs (0-48h) — MAXIMUM priority
70% of revenue. Peak adrenaline. Goal: 2-3 sexting sessions in 48 hours.

### Segment B: Spenders — HIGH priority
Proven buyers. Shorter rapport. Faster path to sale.

### Segment C: Cold Subs (3+ days, never spent) — LOW priority
Quick qualification attempt. Don't invest heavy time.

---

## VII. Journey Structure

### New Sub Journey (0-48h)

```
WELCOME (auto, 1 msg)
  ↓ 2-3 min
AUTO FOLLOW-UP 1 (auto)
  ↓ 1-2 min
AUTO FOLLOW-UP 2 (auto) — sub responds
  ↓
RAPPORT (chatter, 7-9 msgs)
  ↓
TEASING BRIDGE (5-7 msgs, delivers PPV 0)
  ↓
SEXTING SEQUENCE #1 (15-20 msgs, PPV 1-4)
  ↓
AFTERCARE (2-3 msgs)
  ↓ 6-12 hours
RE-ENGAGEMENT → SHORT TEASING → SEXTING #2 → AFTERCARE
  ↓
SEXTING #3 if time remains in 48h window
```

### Fast-Track (sub is sexual from message 1)

```
Sub responds sexually to welcome/follow-ups
  ↓
SKIP full rapport → 2-3 flirty messages
  ↓
TEASING BRIDGE (shortened, 3-4 msgs)
  ↓
SEXTING SEQUENCE → AFTERCARE
```

**Rule**: If the sub sends anything sexual in his first 3 messages, activate fast-track. Don't waste time on rapport he doesn't need.

### Spender Journey

```
RE-ENGAGEMENT or MASS MESSAGE
  ↓
SHORT RAPPORT (3-5 msgs)
  ↓
SHORT TEASING (3-4 msgs)
  ↓
SEXTING → AFTERCARE
```

---

## VIII. Module Strategy

### Welcome Message
- SHORT. 1-2 sentences max + content.
- Never mention automation.
- Include free content (photos) as immediate value.
- Create anticipation for conversation.
- Test with/without Welcome PPV ($5-10).

### Auto Follow-ups
- AF-1: 2-3 min after welcome. Context setter with ego boost ("I was about to leave but you're too interesting").
- AF-2: 1-2 min after AF-1. Engagement hook (ask name).
- Total time from welcome to engagement: 3-5 min.

### Rapport
- 7-9 messages. NOT an interview.
- Model shares first, sub reciprocates.
- 3 blocks: Ice-break (name + why subbed) → Vibe (personality + common ground + light flirting) → Heat (escalate flirting → pivot)
- Ego boost #1: specific reaction to something sub shared.
- Qualification: if monosyllables after 5 msgs, deprioritize.
- If sub is already sexual, activate fast-track.

### Teasing Bridge
- 5-7 messages.
- Natural PIVOT moment (physical context: in bed, post-shower, trying something on).
- "I don't do this with everyone" = maximum 1 time here.
- Model LEADS. Never asks permission.
- PPV 0 (free) as natural climax of the teasing.
- Sub must feel HE caused this.

### Sexting Sequence
- 15-20 messages. 4-5 PPVs.
- Intensity curve WITH CONTRAST:
```
PPV 0 delivered in teasing bridge
  → build 6→7→8 → PAUSE → PPV 1
  → brief cooldown → build 8→9 → PAUSE → PPV 2
  → NO cooldown, energy continues → 9→10 → PAUSE → PPV 3
  → maintain 10 → PAUSE → PPV 4 (climax)
```
- Cooldown ONLY after PPV 1 (marks the shift from teasing to sexting). After PPV 2 and 3, energy continues.
- Pause Points before EVERY PPV (2-3 min, 1-2 min for climax).
- Reaction Slots: minimum 3 per sequence.
- Branch Points after EVERY PPV.
- Messages between PPVs = ACTUAL sexting (graphic, explicit), not just build-up.
- Ego boost #2 pre-PPV: "what you said made me do this."
- "Never done this" MAX 1 time: save for PPV 3 or 4.
- Explicit language escalates with PPV number.

**Variety between sequences:**

| Sequence | Dynamic | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Sex1 | Dominant model | She commands. "I'll tell you what to do." |
| Sex2 | Sub "controls" | "what do you want me to do? you're making me..." |
| Sex3 | Intimacy | "I feel something real... let me show you" |
| Sex4 | Game/challenge | "earn the next one... if you can turn me on with words" |
| Sex5+ | Mix | Combine dynamics based on model |

### Objection & Resistance System

**Philosophy**: Objection handling is NOT begging. It's a structured psychological system that alternates between positive and negative motivation, using different angles each step. The goal is to convert — but never at the cost of destroying the relationship for future sessions.

**Three categories** — the chatter must understand WHEN to use each:

- **A. Objection Handling (OBJ)** — Fan pushes back on buying PPV. Goal: convert the sale.
- **B. Resistance Handling (RES)** — Fan resists the direction of the conversation. Goal: redirect.
- **C. Situational Scripts (SIT)** — Not objections. Specific moments that need prepared responses. Goal: maintain momentum.

#### The 12 Techniques

| # | Technique | What it is | When to use | Tone |
|---|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | **Reframe** | Shift perception of value ("3 min video vs $5 coffee") | Price objection, first line | Positive |
| 2 | **Takeaway** | Withdraw the offer ("fine, I'll keep it for someone else") | After 2+ failed attempts | Negative |
| 3 | **Guilt / Investment** | Emphasize effort she put in ("I spent 10 min recording this for YOU") | Silent ignorer, 1st attempt | Positive |
| 4 | **Challenge (Competence)** | "maybe you can't handle what I did in this one" | Price, no PPV, silent | Negative |
| 5 | **Challenge (Worthiness)** | "I only share my best stuff with guys I really connect with... and I thought you were one of them" | After rapport built | Positive |
| 6 | **Challenge (Courage)** | "are you afraid of what you might see? 😏" | Light, playful contexts | Negative |
| 7 | **Downgrade** | Offer reduced price (20-30%) ONE TIME. Not free. | Price objection, step 2 | Positive |
| 8 | **Social Proof** | "most guys who see this one come back saying it's the best they've seen on here" | Silent ignorer | Positive |
| 9 | **FOMO (Temporal)** | "I'm only in this mood rn... idk if I'll feel this way again" | After building momentum | Negative |
| 10 | **FOMO (Content)** | "I might delete this... it was only for you" | NR waves, late attempts | Negative |
| 11 | **Seed + Return** | Accept the no, continue sexting, then casually retry later | After 2+ hard rejections | Neutral |
| 12 | **Pay What You Want** | "send me whatever you want, I just need you to see this" | "I don't buy PPVs" | Positive |

#### Core Psychological Principles

1. **Never argue, always redirect.** "No it's not expensive" = lost. "Wait until you see it" = redirected.
2. **Loss aversion > Gain framing.** People fear losing 2x more than they desire gaining. "You'll miss this" > "You'll love this."
3. **Ego is the most powerful lever.** "I thought you were different" / "Most guys can't handle this" → makes the purchase about HIS identity, not money.
4. **Reciprocity creates obligation.** "I spent 10 min recording this FOR YOU" → psychological debt.
5. **Commitment & consistency.** He already bought PPV 0 and 1 → "You've come this far... you can't stop now."
6. **Alternate positive/negative.** Never 3 negatives in a row. Ego → Takeaway → Ego → FOMO.
7. **Every "no" is information.** Price? Identity? Trust? Each reveals the real resistance and needs a different angle.

#### Wave System (No Response)

When the sub goes silent after a PPV, do NOT spam the same type of message. Use escalating waves with DIFFERENT psychological angles.

| Wave | Timing | Approach | Example |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| W1 | 2-3 min | Simple ping | "baby? 🥺" |
| W2 | 3-5 min later | Curiosity + urgency | "you need to see what I just did for you... seriously 🥵" |
| W3 | 5-10 min later | Takeaway + FOMO content | "okay I guess you're busy 😏 might delete this, it was only for you" |
| W4 | 15-30 min later | Warm close (no selling) | "hey I hope you're okay 💗 hmu when you're back" |
| W5 | 2-6 hrs later | Fresh re-engagement | New conversation. Reference something from earlier. Don't retry the same PPV. |

**Hard limit: 5 waves.** After W4 with no response, only W5 as re-engagement. Never insist further.

#### A. Objection Handling Protocols (OBJ)

**OBJ-PRICE: "Too expensive"** (max 5 steps — standalone scripts, NOT a sequence):
1. Reframe value (positive)
2. FOMO temporal (negative)
3. Challenge competence (negative)
4. Downgrade — one-time 20-30% discount (positive)
5. Seed + Return — accept, continue sexting, retry later (neutral)

**OBJ-DISCOUNT: "Give me a discount"** (max 4 steps):
1. Firmness + value statement (positive)
2. Challenge worthiness (negative)
3. Concession — one-time small discount, frame as EXCLUSIVE not cheap (positive)
4. Takeaway if still pushing (negative)

**OBJ-FREE: "Send it for free"** (max 4 steps):
1. Reminder PPV 0 was free + tease value (positive)
2. Challenge worthiness (negative)
3. Guilt/investment — "I recorded this FOR you" (positive)
4. Seed + Return (neutral)

**OBJ-NOMONEY: "I don't have money"** (max 4 steps):
1. Empathy — disarm, don't judge (positive)
2. Test sincerity — "not even [small amount]?" (neutral)
3. Mini-offer — lowest viable price or "pay what you want" (positive)
4. Protect relationship — accept, continue GFE, tag for re-engagement (neutral)

**OBJ-NOPPV: "I don't buy PPVs"** (max 4 steps):
1. Accept — disarm the identity stance: "that's okay" (positive)
2. Continue text sexting 4-5 msgs, build tension (neutral)
3. Emotional reframe — "this isn't about money, I need you to see what you did to me" (positive)
4. Pay what you want — breaks the "no PPV" identity (positive)

**OBJ-CARD: "Card doesn't work"** (max 3 steps):
1. Empathy + suggest retry: "aww try again, it happens sometimes" (positive)
2. Suggest alternative: "try a different card?" (neutral)
3. Soft urgency: "I really want you to see this before I change my mind 😏" (positive)

**OBJ-IGNORE: Fan ignores PPV sent** (max 5 steps — use NR Wave system):
Uses the Wave System above. Each wave is a standalone script, NOT a sequence (timing gaps between each).

#### B. Resistance Handling Protocols (RES)

**RES-NOSEX: Doesn't want to go sexual** (max 4 steps):
1. Respect — "haha okay okay" (positive)
2. Build subtle tension — flirt without being explicit (neutral)
3. Re-attempt pivot — create natural opening (positive)
4. Accept — if still no, continue GFE, never force it. They may convert in a future session. (neutral)

**RES-OFFTOPIC: Goes off-topic / doesn't follow the flow** (max 3 steps):
1. Acknowledge what they said (positive)
2. Redirect with a hook — "haha wait but you haven't heard what I was about to say..." (positive)
3. Retake control — model leads back to the flow (neutral)

**RES-REAL: "Are you real?" / "Is this pre-recorded?"** (max 3 steps):
1. Humor + redirect — "lol do I sound like a robot to you? 😏" (positive)
2. Challenge — invert power: "ask me anything, I'll prove it" (negative)
3. Emotional grounding — "I get why you'd think that, but you felt that connection right?" (positive)

**RES-VOICE: "Send me a voice note" / "Let's video call"** (max 3 steps):
1. Playful dodge — "haha maybe if you're lucky 😏" (positive)
2. Redirect to content — "I have something better for you..." (positive)
3. Firm if they insist — "I don't do that here but trust me what I have is way better 😈" (negative)

**RES-CUSTOM-YES: Asks for content the model HAS** (max 3 steps — can be a 2-msg sequence):
1. Tease — "mmm you want that? 😏 I might have something..." (positive)
2. Price + build anticipation (neutral)
3. Deliver (positive)

**RES-CUSTOM-NO: Asks for content the model DOESN'T have** (max 3 steps):
1. Redirect — "I don't have exactly that but I have something even better..." (positive)
2. Offer alternative + FOMO (positive)
3. If insists — "trust me, what I'm about to show you will make you forget you asked 😏" (positive)

**RES-DONE: "I already came" / he finished before final PPV** (max 3 steps):
1. Validate — "fuck that's hot 🥵" (positive)
2. Rescue — "but I haven't finished yet... don't you wanna see me cum?" (positive/challenge)
3. Soft seed — if no, continue GFE, seed next session (neutral)

#### C. Situational Scripts (SIT)

**SIT-CUM: He's close to cumming** (3 standalone scripts — pick based on moment):
- Slow down: control pacing to extend session and sell more PPVs
- Sync: time his orgasm with the final PPV delivery
- Edge: tease delay — "don't cum yet... I'm not done with you"

**SIT-DICKPIC: He sends a dick pic** (2-3 standalone scripts):
- React positively → use as leverage for PPV ("fuck 🥵 now you NEED to see what I just did")
- Never ignore it. Always acknowledge. It's an opportunity, not a problem.

**SIT-HORNY: Mid-sexting intensity boosters** (pool of 6-8 standalone scripts):
- NOT a sequence. Chatter picks from a pool of messages to maintain sexting energy between PPVs.
- These are NOT objection responses — they're filler messages for when the conversation needs fuel.

#### Rules
- **Alternate positive/negative** motivation. Never 3 negatives in a row.
- **Never repeat the same technique** twice for the same objection.
- **Hard limits are real.** Exceeding them = desperate = relationship destroyed.
- **Downgrade price ONCE.** Never offer a second discount.
- **FOMO must be credible.** If she says "I'll delete it" — the chatter must follow through (or at least not send it again for free later).
- **Challenge sales must stay playful.** Aggressive challenge + high pressure = sub feels attacked and leaves.
- **After protocol exhausted:** Accept. Continue text sexting or go to aftercare. Tag sub for re-engagement in next session. The relationship is worth more than one PPV.
- **Script vs Sequence:** Each OBJ step is typically a standalone script (chatter waits for sub response between steps). Only use sequences when 2+ messages go together without needing sub response in between.

### Aftercare
- 2 validation messages. NOT a goodbye.
- Ego boost #3: specific reference to something from the conversation.
- **NEVER close the conversation.** The goal is to keep talking, build emotional bond, create a girlfriend experience (GFE).
- After validation msgs: ask about him, be warm and personal, react to what he says, share things about "her" life.
- The sub just bought 4+ PPVs — he's invested. Reward him with real connection. This is what makes him come back.
- Seed the next content set naturally during ongoing conversation, not as a sign-off.
- Only use Re-engagement messages if the conversation dies naturally on its own.

### Re-engagement
- 1-2 messages.
- Reference previous session specifically.
- Create situational urgency ("I'm in a mood rn").
- Connect to the seed planted in aftercare.

### Mass Messages
- 3-5 per day (NOT 10-20).
- Never sound like a broadcast.
- Distribution: morning (lifestyle), afternoon (engagement), night (sexual tease).
- Max 1 PPV mass per day.
- Short, like a personal text.

## IX. Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

1. Never say "this is an automatic message"
2. Never repeat "I never do this" more than 2 times in a journey
3. Never send messages of consistent length — variation = human
4. Never ask 2+ questions in a row without sharing something
5. Never use emotional vulnerability during sexting
6. Never keep sending script messages if the sub isn't responding — use Branch Points
7. Never give generic ego boosts — must be specific
8. Never have the model ask permission to be sexual — she leads
9. Never cooldown after every PPV — only when strategically needed
10. Never send 3+ consecutive messages without a sub response (except pre-PPV intensity)
11. Never respond in under 10 seconds — feels like a bot
12. Never keep the same pricing if sub shows buying resistance — adapt

---

## X. Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any script:

- [ ] Most messages are 1-2 sentences? (20% micro, 50% short, 25% medium, 5% long)
- [ ] "I never do this" appears max 2 times in the entire journey?
- [ ] Minimum 3 Reaction Slots in the sexting sequence?
- [ ] Pause Points before EVERY PPV?
- [ ] Branch Points after EVERY PPV?
- [ ] Sexting is explicitly graphic from PPV 2 onwards?
- [ ] Ego boosts are specific (not generic)?
- [ ] Message lengths vary visibly (not all the same)?
- [ ] There are texture messages (emojis only, micro reactions)?
- [ ] Model's personality is present in every message?
- [ ] Sub couldn't detect the pattern after 2 sessions?
- [ ] Emotional vulnerability only in microdoses outside sexting?
- [ ] Model leads at all times (never asks permission)?
- [ ] Aftercare validates but NEVER closes? (GFE, keep talking, no goodbye)
- [ ] Fast-track path exists for already-sexual subs?
- [ ] Timing guidelines are noted for chatter?
- [ ] No Response uses wave system (5 waves, different angles)?
- [ ] Objection protocols have hard step limits?
- [ ] Positive/negative motivation alternates in objection sequences?
- [ ] Downgrade offered only ONCE per session?
- [ ] Challenge sales stay playful, not aggressive?
- [ ] FOMO is credible and not overused?

## XI. Infloww Export Format

When exporting scripts to xlsx for Infloww import:

**1 file = 1 creator.** Each xlsx file contains all sequences for one creator. Each sheet/tab becomes a separate folder/tag in Infloww.

**Structure:**
- Row 1 (header): `Name` | `Text` | `Note` | `*Guidelines` (col D is reference only, not imported)
- Data rows: columns A (Name), B (Text), C (Note)
- Tag/sheet name: max 32 chars

**CRITICAL — Row order is REVERSED.** Infloww places the first row as the LAST message in the sequence. So the LAST message of the sequence goes in row 2 (first data row), and the FIRST message goes in the last data row. Always build the Excel bottom-to-top.

**Automated messages are NOT included.** W-1 (welcome), AF-1, and AF-2 (auto follow-ups) are all automated — they are NOT sent by the chatter. These are configured separately inside Infloww. The Excel only contains messages the chatter actually sends, starting from R-1 (first rapport message).

**Customer Journey = 1 sheet.** The entire chatter flow (R → TB → S → AC) goes in a single sheet. Do NOT separate rapport and sexting into different sheets.

**What goes in the journey sheet:** AF → R → TB → S → AC (all in one sheet, reversed order)
**Separate sheets for:** NR Waves, Personal Info, Positive Spin, Re-engagement, Objection Handling, and any model-specific utilities (e.g., Meetup Redirect for dating app creators, Location Handling).

**Character limits:**
- Name: up to 64 characters
- Tag (sheet name): up to 32 characters
- Text: up to 1000 characters
- Note: up to 246 characters

**Color coding (optional but recommended):**
- PPV send rows: orange background (#F6B26B) on Text column — makes it easy to spot where media needs to be attached after import
- Alternating row colors in sexting phases for readability
- WAIT rows can use a distinct color too

**Reference template:** `c:\Users\34683\Downloads\LiaScriptsINFLOWW2.xlsx` (Lia — working import confirmed)

### Scripts vs Sequences in Infloww

**Script** = A single standalone message. The chatter picks it and sends it manually when they decide it's the right moment.

**Sequence** = A chain of scripts that activate in order. When the chatter sends the first script in a sequence, Infloww automatically queues the next message in the chatbox. The chatter can still edit each message before sending, but the flow is pre-loaded and ready to go step by step.

**CRITICAL — Infloww marks scripts/sequences as USED.** Once a chatter activates a sequence or script, Infloww marks it. This means:
- You CANNOT reuse the same sequence with the same fan
- For situations that repeat (e.g., fan says "too expensive" again next session), you need MULTIPLE COMPLETE sequences with different wording
- Each sequence must be self-contained — NEVER mix variant wording within one sequence

**When to use a sequence:**
- The customer journey (R → TB → S → AC) is ONE sequence
- **OBJ/RES handling: each complete escalation path = one sequence.** Example: `\price1` is a full 5-step price objection sequence. `\price2` is an ENTIRELY different 5-step sequence with different wording for the same situation.
- NR Waves can be a sequence
- Any multi-message flow where the chatter sends 2+ messages in a row

**When to use standalone scripts (NOT a sequence):**
- Personal Info responses (chatter picks based on what sub asked)
- Positive Spin responses (chatter picks based on what sub shared)
- Situational scripts (dickpic response, cum management, horny boosters) — these are single-message reactions, not escalations

**Naming for Infloww commands:**
- The chatter types `\commandname` to activate a script/sequence
- Names MUST be short, lowercase, no spaces: `\price1`, `\nosex2`, `\card1`
- Max 32 chars for sheet/tag name (which becomes the command)
- Pattern: `\protocol` + number → `\price1`, `\price2`, `\free1`, `\free2`
- For standalone situational: `\edge1`, `\sync1`, `\dpsext1`, `\h1`

**OBJ/RES sequence structure:**
- Each protocol (e.g., PRICE) gets 2-3 complete sequences
- Each sequence has ALL steps of the escalation with consistent wording
- Example: `\price1` = Reframe(A) → FOMO(A) → Challenge(A) → Downgrade(A) → Seed(A)
- Example: `\price2` = Reframe(B) → FOMO(B) → Challenge(B) → Downgrade(B) → Seed(B)
- The chatter uses `\price1` first time, `\price2` next time the same fan objects
- In the XLSX, each sequence = its own sheet (sheet name = command name)

**Emoji rule for OBJ/RES scripts:**
- Objection handling should feel NATURAL, not scripted — reduce emojis
- Target: ~40% of messages with 1 emoji, 60% with zero
- Emojis feel forced during tense moments (objections, resistance)
- Exception: Situational scripts (SIT-HORNY boosters) can have more emojis
