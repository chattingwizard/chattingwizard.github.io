# Chatting Wizard — Script Strategy & Framework v2

## I. Core Principles

**1. The real-time illusion is sacred.**
Everything the chatter sends must reinforce the belief that the model is there, right now, interacting with this specific sub. Any element that breaks this (perfect messages, repetitive patterns, no references to what the sub says) destroys the sale.

**2. The sub must never feel he's following a script.**
Scripts are for the chatter, not the sub. The sub experiences a real, unpredictable, human conversation. This requires: short varied messages, Reaction Slots, "texture messages" (emojis alone, broken sentences, typos), and pattern-breaking.

**3. Every message has a strategic purpose.**
No filler. Each message does one of: (a) builds rapport, (b) qualifies the sub, (c) increases arousal, (d) prepares the sale, (e) sells, (f) retains. If it doesn't do any, cut it.

**4. The model LEADS, the sub FOLLOWS.**
She never asks permission. Not "can I show you something?" — instead "hold on, let me show you something." She sets the pace, she decides when to escalate, she sends the content. The sub feels pulled by her energy, not sold to.

**5. Sexual energy is the engine. Emotional connection is the fuel.**
The sub pays for sexual excitement. Emotional connection makes it feel REAL and makes the sub COME BACK. But the product is the sexual experience, not the relationship. Never sacrifice sexual energy for an emotional beat during sexting.

## II. Sub Psychology — Why They Spend

| Driver | What it is | How we activate it |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Arousal** | He's horny and wants more content | Explicit sexting + PPV escalation |
| **Ego** | He feels desired, attractive, special | Specific reactions to what HE says/is |
| **Control** | He feels HIS actions cause her reaction | "what you said made me do this" + Reaction Slots |
| **Fantasy** | He believes this could be real | Real-time illusion + credible model personality |
| **Scarcity** | He feels this moment is unique | "I've never done this" (max 2x) + temporal urgency |

---

## III. Psychology Toolkit

### A. Sexual Vulnerability (USE GENEROUSLY)

She "loses control" because of HIM. Feeds ego + control drivers.

**Yes**:
- "you're making me do things I don't normally do"
- "I can't believe I just did that... it's your fault"
- "fuck I didn't plan on going this far but I can't stop"

**No** (emotional vulnerability — microdoses only):
- ~~"nobody talks to me like a real person"~~
- ~~"I feel so lonely here"~~
- ~~"you're the only one who understands me"~~

**Rule**: Emotional vulnerability = ONE throwaway line in rapport ("it's nice talking to someone real for once"). Never during sexting. Never as central theme.

### B. Ego Amplification (3 STRATEGIC MOMENTS)

Not constant. Specific. Earned.

| Moment | How | Example |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **Rapport** | Positive reaction to something sub shared | "wait you ride motorcycles? that's actually really hot" |
| **Pre-PPV** | What sub said/did CAUSED the content | "what you told me made me lose it... I had to record this" |
| **Aftercare** | Reinforce that he's special | "honestly the way you [specific thing] was different" |

**Rule**: Always reference something CONCRETE. Never generic ("you're amazing"). The sub must feel the compliment is unique to him.

### C. Attainability Frame (REAL GIRL WHO CHOOSES YOU)

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "I'm a real girl who finds YOU attractive" | "I'm lonely and you're the only one" |
| "there's something about you specifically" | "nobody ever talks to me" |
| "I chose to show you this" | "I need someone like you" |

She's a real girl, with a real life, who is out of the sub's league but somehow attracted to HIM. He has to "earn" her attention. PPVs are proof he deserves more of her.

### D. Positive Spin (NEVER INSULT THE OPPOSITE GROUP)

When the sub shares something about himself, ALWAYS amplify the positive in a way that's credible for the model's persona.

**Bad**: "I'm tired of [opposite], finally someone like you"
**Good**: Find something genuinely attractive and amplify it

Age examples:
- Sub 45+: "mmm I love older guys... there's something about the confidence 😏"
- Sub 20s: "omg you're around my age? that's so rare here, I feel like we'd actually vibe irl"

**Rule**: Never a flippable template. Always a natural, believable reaction.

### E. Scarcity & Urgency

- "I'm in this mood RIGHT NOW" (temporal — act now or lose it)
- "I've never shown this to anyone" (exclusivity — MAX 2 times per journey)
- "I just recorded this" (unrepeatable — reinforces real-time)

**Rule**: Scarcity is temporal and situational, never artificial. "Only today" sounds like a salesman. "I'm feeling like this right now" sounds real.

## IV. Message Rules

### Length

| Type | Length | Frequency | Example |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Micro | 2-5 words | 20% | "fuck 🥵", "you hard?", "😏😏😏" |
| Short | 1 sentence | 50% | "you're making me feel things rn" |
| Medium | 2 sentences | 25% | "I can't stop thinking about what you said. hold on let me show you" |
| Long | 3+ sentences | 5% (welcome + rare key moments) | Reserved for welcome message only |

### Pattern-breaking

- **Texture messages**: solo emojis, one-word reactions ("omg", "fuck", "wait"), incomplete sentences ("I literally just... no hold on")
- **Structural variation**: not every message ends with emoji. Some without. Some emoji-only.
- **Intentional imperfection**: occasional typos, irregular letter repetition ("fuckkk" but not every message), unfinished thoughts
- **Tonal variation**: not everything is sexual. A random comment, humor, unexpected question breaks predictability

### Explicitness Progression

| Phase | Level | Language |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Rapport | 0/10 | Zero sexual. Casual, friendly, flirty at the end. |
| Teasing Bridge | 3-5/10 | Innuendo, double meaning, "feeling things" |
| Sexting pre-PPV1 | 5-6/10 | "I'm getting wet", "I want to touch myself" |
| Sexting PPV1→PPV2 | 7-8/10 | Oral descriptions, undressing, explicit body references |
| Sexting PPV2→PPV3 | 8-9/10 | Crude language: "fuck my pussy", "your cock", graphic acts |
| Sexting PPV3→PPV4 | 9-10/10 | No filter. Graphic. Orgasm. Raw as possible. |

### Timing Guidelines

| Context | Chatter response time |
|---------|----------------------|
| Rapport | 30-90 seconds |
| Teasing | 20-60 seconds |
| Sexting (between PPVs) | 15-45 seconds (she's more "into it") |
| Pause Points (pre-PPV) | 2-3 minutes (simulates recording) |
| Pause Point (climax PPV) | 1-2 minutes (urgency is high) |

### Autopilot-Safe Rule (MANDATORY)

**Every script message MUST work as-is without any edits from the chatter.** No `[FILL]`, no blanks, no freestyle required. The chatter should be able to send every message by just pressing the button.

**Optional personalization goes in the Note column only.** The message must make sense and sound natural even if the chatter ignores the note completely.

**Note column rules:**
- **Short and clear.** Max 1-2 sentences. No fluff.
- **Direct instructions, not suggestions.** Say "Add his name before 'hi'." NOT "If you can, add his name before 'hi'."
- **Action-oriented.** Tell the chatter exactly WHAT to do: "WAIT 2 MIN", "Send PPV 1 — $10", "Wait for response."
- **No vague language.** No "if you can", "try to", "you might want to". Just tell them what to do.

**Why:** Chatters operate on autopilot. A script that requires creative input will result in errors, broken immersion, or chatters skipping the personalization entirely. Default messages that work out of the box = consistent quality at scale.

**Name personalization:** Use generic terms ("baby", "babe") as default. If the chatter knows the sub's name, they can swap it in — but the script never depends on it.

### Consecutive Message Rule

**Maximum 2 messages in a row without a sub response.** Exception: high-intensity pre-PPV moments. If the chatter sends 3+ messages without the sub responding, it becomes a monologue and the illusion breaks.

## V. The PPV Ladder

| PPV | Content | Price Range | Purpose |
|-----|---------|-------------|---------|
| PPV 0 (Teaser) | Lingerie/clothed, nothing revealed | FREE | Hook visually, create desire |
| PPV 1 | Starting to undress, partial reveal | $5–$15 | Break the buying barrier |
| PPV 2 | More explicit, longer | $20–$35 | Escalate spend |
| PPV 3 | Very explicit | $35–$50 | High-value at peak arousal |
| PPV 4+ | Most explicit, climax | $50+ | Maximum extraction |

### Adaptive Pricing

- Sub bought fast, no hesitation → push to HIGH end of next PPV's range
- Sub took time to buy or seemed hesitant → stay at LOW end
- Sub objected on price → offer 20-30% discount ONE TIME, then hold firm
- Never discount PPV 0 (it's already free)

---

## VI. Customer Segments

### Segment A: New Subs (0-48h) — MAXIMUM priority
70% of revenue. Peak adrenaline. Goal: 2-3 sexting sessions in 48 hours.

### Segment B: Spenders — HIGH priority
Proven buyers. Shorter rapport. Faster path to sale.

### Segment C: Cold Subs (3+ days, never spent) — LOW priority
Quick qualification attempt. Don't invest heavy time.

---

## VII. Journey Structure

### New Sub Journey (0-48h)

```
WELCOME (auto, 1 msg)
  ↓ 2-3 min
AUTO FOLLOW-UP 1 (auto)
  ↓ 1-2 min
AUTO FOLLOW-UP 2 (auto) — sub responds
  ↓
RAPPORT (chatter, 7-9 msgs)
  ↓
TEASING BRIDGE (5-7 msgs, delivers PPV 0)
  ↓
SEXTING SEQUENCE #1 (15-20 msgs, PPV 1-4)
  ↓
AFTERCARE (2-3 msgs)
  ↓ 6-12 hours
RE-ENGAGEMENT → SHORT TEASING → SEXTING #2 → AFTERCARE
  ↓
SEXTING #3 if time remains in 48h window
```

### Fast-Track (sub is sexual from message 1)

```
Sub responds sexually to welcome/follow-ups
  ↓
SKIP full rapport → 2-3 flirty messages
  ↓
TEASING BRIDGE (shortened, 3-4 msgs)
  ↓
SEXTING SEQUENCE → AFTERCARE
```

**Rule**: If the sub sends anything sexual in his first 3 messages, activate fast-track. Don't waste time on rapport he doesn't need.

### Spender Journey

```
RE-ENGAGEMENT or MASS MESSAGE
  ↓
SHORT RAPPORT (3-5 msgs)
  ↓
SHORT TEASING (3-4 msgs)
  ↓
SEXTING → AFTERCARE
```

## VIII. Module Strategy

### Welcome Message
- SHORT. 1-2 sentences max + content.
- Never mention automation.
- Include free content (photos) as immediate value.
- Create anticipation for conversation.
- Test with/without Welcome PPV ($5-10).

### Auto Follow-ups
- AF-1: 2-3 min after welcome. Context setter with ego boost ("I was about to leave but you're too interesting").
- AF-2: 1-2 min after AF-1. Engagement hook (ask name).
- Total time from welcome to engagement: 3-5 min.

### Rapport
- 7-9 messages. NOT an interview.
- Model shares first, sub reciprocates.
- 3 blocks: Ice-break (name + why subbed) → Vibe (personality + common ground + light flirting) → Heat (escalate flirting → pivot)
- Ego boost #1: specific reaction to something sub shared.
- Qualification: if monosyllables after 5 msgs, deprioritize.
- If sub is already sexual, activate fast-track.

### Teasing Bridge
- 5-7 messages.
- Natural PIVOT moment (physical context: in bed, post-shower, trying something on).
- "I don't do this with everyone" = maximum 1 time here.
- Model LEADS. Never asks permission.
- PPV 0 (free) as natural climax of the teasing.
- Sub must feel HE caused this.

### Sexting Sequence
- 15-20 messages. 4-5 PPVs.
- Intensity curve WITH CONTRAST:
```
PPV 0 delivered in teasing bridge
  → build 6→7→8 → PAUSE → PPV 1
  → brief cooldown → build 8→9 → PAUSE → PPV 2
  → NO cooldown, energy continues → 9→10 → PAUSE → PPV 3
  → maintain 10 → PAUSE → PPV 4 (climax)
```
- Cooldown ONLY after PPV 1 (marks the shift from teasing to sexting). After PPV 2 and 3, energy continues.
- Pause Points before EVERY PPV (2-3 min, 1-2 min for climax).
- Reaction Slots: minimum 3 per sequence.
- Branch Points after EVERY PPV.
- Messages between PPVs = ACTUAL sexting (graphic, explicit), not just build-up.
- Ego boost #2 pre-PPV: "what you said made me do this."
- "Never done this" MAX 1 time: save for PPV 3 or 4.
- Explicit language escalates with PPV number.

**Variety between sequences:**

| Sequence | Dynamic | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Sex1 | Dominant model | She commands. "I'll tell you what to do." |
| Sex2 | Sub "controls" | "what do you want me to do? you're making me..." |
| Sex3 | Intimacy | "I feel something real... let me show you" |
| Sex4 | Game/challenge | "earn the next one... if you can turn me on with words" |
| Sex5+ | Mix | Combine dynamics based on model |

### Objection Handling System

**Philosophy**: Objection handling is NOT begging. It's a structured psychological sequence that alternates between positive and negative motivation, using different angles each step. The goal is to convert — but never at the cost of destroying the relationship for future sessions.

#### The 10 Techniques

| # | Technique | What it is | When to use | Tone |
|---|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | **Reframe** | Shift perception of value ("3 min video vs $5 coffee") | Price objection, first line | Positive |
| 2 | **Takeaway** | Withdraw the offer ("fine, I'll keep it for someone else") | After 2+ failed attempts | Negative |
| 3 | **Guilt / Investment** | Emphasize effort she put in ("I spent 10 min recording this for YOU") | Silent ignorer, 1st attempt | Positive |
| 4 | **Challenge (Competence)** | "maybe you can't handle what I did in this one" | Price, no PPV, silent | Negative |
| 5 | **Challenge (Worthiness)** | "I only share my best stuff with guys I really connect with... and I thought you were one of them" | After rapport built | Positive |
| 6 | **Challenge (Courage)** | "are you afraid of what you might see? 😏" | Light, playful contexts | Negative |
| 7 | **Downgrade** | Offer reduced price (20-30%) ONE TIME. Not free. | Price objection, step 2 | Positive |
| 8 | **Social Proof** | "most guys who see this one come back saying it's the best they've seen on here" | Silent ignorer | Positive |
| 9 | **FOMO (Temporal)** | "I'm only in this mood rn... idk if I'll feel this way again" | After building momentum | Negative |
| 10 | **FOMO (Content)** | "I might delete this... it was only for you" | NR waves, late attempts | Negative |
| 11 | **Seed + Return** | Accept the no, continue sexting, then casually retry later | After 2+ hard rejections | Neutral |
| 12 | **Pay What You Want** | "send me whatever you want, I just need you to see this" | "I don't buy PPVs" | Positive |

#### Wave System (No Response)

When the sub goes silent after a PPV, do NOT spam the same type of message. Use escalating waves with DIFFERENT psychological angles.

| Wave | Timing | Approach | Example |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| W1 | 2-3 min | Simple ping | "baby? 🥺" |
| W2 | 3-5 min later | Curiosity + urgency | "you need to see what I just did for you... seriously 🥵" |
| W3 | 5-10 min later | Takeaway + FOMO content | "okay I guess you're busy 😏 might delete this, it was only for you" |
| W4 | 15-30 min later | Warm close (no selling) | "hey I hope you're okay 💗 hmu when you're back" |
| W5 | 2-6 hrs later | Fresh re-engagement | New conversation. Reference something from earlier. Don't retry the same PPV. |

**Hard limit: 5 waves.** After W4 with no response, only W5 as re-engagement. Never insist further.

#### Objection Protocols

**"TOO EXPENSIVE"** (max 6 steps):
1. Reframe value
2. Downgrade (one-time 20-30% discount)
3. FOMO temporal
4. Challenge competence
5. Takeaway
6. Seed + Return (continue sexting, retry later)

**"SEND FREE FIRST"** (max 4 steps):
1. Reminder (PPV 0 was free) + tease value
2. Downgrade price (not free)
3. Challenge
4. Seed + Return

**"I DON'T BUY PPVs"** (max 4 steps):
1. Accept (disarms) — "that's okay baby"
2. Continue text sexting 4-5 msgs, build tension
3. Emotional reframe — "this isn't about money, I need you to see what you're doing to me"
4. Pay what you want — breaks the "no PPV" identity

**"ARE YOU REAL?"** (max 3 steps):
1. Humor + redirect
2. Challenge (inverts power — "ask me anything")
3. Emotional grounding — "I get it, but you felt that right?"

**CHAT-ONLY SUB** (ignores PPVs without objecting, max 5 steps):
1. Guilt/investment
2. Investment amplification
3. Social proof
4. Challenge (ego)
5. Accept + protect relationship, log for re-engagement

#### Rules
- **Alternate positive/negative** motivation. Never 3 negatives in a row.
- **Never repeat the same technique** twice for the same objection.
- **Hard limits are real.** Exceeding them = desperate = relationship destroyed.
- **Downgrade price ONCE.** Never offer a second discount.
- **FOMO must be credible.** If she says "I'll delete it" — the chatter must follow through (or at least not send it again for free later).
- **Challenge sales must stay playful.** Aggressive challenge + high pressure = sub feels attacked and leaves.
- **After protocol exhausted:** Accept. Continue text sexting or go to aftercare. Tag sub for re-engagement in next session. The relationship is worth more than one PPV.

### Aftercare
- 2 validation messages. NOT a goodbye.
- Ego boost #3: specific reference to something from the conversation.
- **NEVER close the conversation.** The goal is to keep talking, build emotional bond, create a girlfriend experience (GFE).
- After validation msgs: ask about him, be warm and personal, react to what he says, share things about "her" life.
- The sub just bought 4+ PPVs — he's invested. Reward him with real connection. This is what makes him come back.
- Seed the next content set naturally during ongoing conversation, not as a sign-off.
- Only use Re-engagement messages if the conversation dies naturally on its own.

### Re-engagement
- 1-2 messages.
- Reference previous session specifically.
- Create situational urgency ("I'm in a mood rn").
- Connect to the seed planted in aftercare.

### Mass Messages
- 3-5 per day (NOT 10-20).
- Never sound like a broadcast.
- Distribution: morning (lifestyle), afternoon (engagement), night (sexual tease).
- Max 1 PPV mass per day.
- Short, like a personal text.

## IX. Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

1. Never say "this is an automatic message"
2. Never repeat "I never do this" more than 2 times in a journey
3. Never send messages of consistent length — variation = human
4. Never ask 2+ questions in a row without sharing something
5. Never use emotional vulnerability during sexting
6. Never keep sending script messages if the sub isn't responding — use Branch Points
7. Never give generic ego boosts — must be specific
8. Never have the model ask permission to be sexual — she leads
9. Never cooldown after every PPV — only when strategically needed
10. Never send 3+ consecutive messages without a sub response (except pre-PPV intensity)
11. Never respond in under 10 seconds — feels like a bot
12. Never keep the same pricing if sub shows buying resistance — adapt

---

## X. Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any script:

- [ ] Most messages are 1-2 sentences? (20% micro, 50% short, 25% medium, 5% long)
- [ ] "I never do this" appears max 2 times in the entire journey?
- [ ] Minimum 3 Reaction Slots in the sexting sequence?

- [ ] Aftercare validates but NEVER closes? (GFE, keep talking, no goodbye)
- [ ] Fast-track path exists for already-sexual subs?
- [ ] Timing guidelines are noted for chatter?
- [ ] No Response uses wave system (5 waves, different angles)?
- [ ] Objection protocols have hard step limits?

## XI. Infloww Export Format

When exporting scripts to xlsx for Infloww import:

**1 sheet = 1 sequence.** Each sheet/tab in the xlsx represents a single sequence that the chatter follows from start to finish. The sheet name becomes the tag in Infloww.

**Structure:**
- Columns: **Name** (command, max 64 chars) | **Text** (script content, max 1000 chars) | **Note** (chatter instructions, max 246 chars)
- Tag/sheet name: max 32 chars

**Customer Journey = 1 sheet.** The entire flow from the first chatter message (W-1) through Aftercare (AC-3) goes in a single sheet, in sequential order. This way the chatter follows one continuous sequence without jumping between tabs.

**What goes in the journey sheet:** W → AF → R → TB → S → AC (all in order)
**What does NOT go in the journey sheet:** Objection handlers, No Response waves, Personal Info, Positive Spin, Re-engagement — these are separate utility sequences if needed.

**Character limits:**
- Name: up to 64 characters
- Tag (sheet name): up to 32 characters
- Text: up to 1000 characters
- Note: up to 246 characters
