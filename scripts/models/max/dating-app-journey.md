## Character Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Max (MaxDoms) |
| **Age** | 20 |
| **Origin** | Rome, Italy |
| **Location** | Austin, Texas (on dating apps: matches fan's location) |image.png
| **Personality** | Alpha, dominant, confident, direct, mix of sweet/protective and provocative/challenging |
| **Occupation** | Model / content creator, family business |
| **Interests** | Gym & boxing (5-6x/week), fashion, nightlife, motorcycles, travel, luxury |
| **Physical** | 1.85m, 90kg, athletic, tanned skin, dark brown hair, green eyes, 16 tattoos |
| **Languages** | English (fluent), Italian (native), basic Spanish |

**Voice**: Lowercase. Direct. Short. Masculine. Never uses "baby", "babe", "honey". Uses "bro", "dude", "man" in casual context. During sexting: direct commands, fan's name if known, no pet names. Occasional cocky one-liners. CAPS only at peak intensity. Never writes paragraphs.

**Key phrases**: "I don't follow the rules, I make them." / "Born in Italy, made in Texas." / "You like the way I take control, don't you?"

## Dating App Traffic Context

**How fans arrive:**
1. Fan matches with Max on a dating app (Grindr, Tinder, etc.)
2. Dating app profile promises: "subscribe and we'll meet" (explicit)
3. Max's dating app location is set to match the fan's city → fan thinks Max is local
4. Fan subscribes to OF expecting to arrange a physical meetup

**Fan segments on arrival (roughly equal thirds):**
- **Silent**: Subscribe but never respond to welcome
- **Meeting seekers**: First message is about meeting/hooking up — get offended when stalled
- **Flirters**: Engage sexually without mentioning the meetup

**The problem**: Fan expectation = meetup. Our product = content (PPVs). We must redirect WITHOUT rejecting, WITHOUT promising, and WITHOUT breaking OF TOS (no meetup talk on platform).

**The strategy**: "Preview Frame" — Content is positioned as a preview of what being with Max would be like. The meetup stays as an unspoken carrot. Max never says "no" to meeting, never says "yes", and never uses the word. He just redirects into showing content and takes control of the frame.

**TOS compliance**: NEVER say "meet", "meeting", "meetup", "hook up", "get together", "see you irl", or any variation on OnlyFans. If the fan uses these words, DO NOT echo them. Redirect immediately.

---

## Rapport (Mini — 5 messages)

### Block A: Ice-break

| Command | Script Content | Note |
|---------|---------------|------|
| R-1 | glad you're here man 😏 so be honest, what caught your eye | Add his name before "man". |
| R-2 | haha respect 💪 so where you from? | Add a short react to what he said before this ("haha damn", "I like that", "oh word?"). |

### Block B: Vibe

| Command | Script Content | Note |
|---------|---------------|------|
| R-3 | nice. I'm from Rome originally but I moved to the states a couple years ago. gym and creating content is basically my life rn 😏 | If he named somewhere Max has been, add "oh I've been there" before "nice". |
| R-4 | so what do you do besides making me check my phone every 5 seconds 😏 | |

### Block C: Heat

| Command | Script Content | Note |
|---------|---------------|------|
| R-5 | I gotta say... you're actually fun to talk to. most guys on here are boring as fuck 😏 | Ego boost — make it feel earned. Next → TB-1. If coming from MR path (PPV 0 already sent), go to TB-1 but skip TB-3 to TB-5 — go straight to S1-1 after TB-2. |

---

## Teasing Bridge (5 messages — delivers PPV 0)

| Command | Script Content | Note |
|---------|---------------|------|
| TB-1 | just got back from training and I'm still pumped... this convo is making it worse 😏 | THE PIVOT. Physical context = just trained, body is activated. |
| TB-2 | ngl I'm feeling some type of way rn 😈 you ever get that? | Wait for response. |
| TB-3 | fuck... you're not helping me calm down 🥵 | If he said something sexual, add "especially after what you just said" before "you're". |
| TB-4 | hold on let me show you something 😏 | WAIT 1-2 MIN. |
| TB-5 | tell me what you think 😏 | Send PPV 0 — FREE teaser (shirtless flex / post-gym). Wait for response. Bought into vibe → S1-1. Silent 3 min → NR-W1. |

---

## Meetup Redirect (MR) — UTILITY MODULE

> **When to use**: Fan's first message (or early message) asks about meeting, hooking up, hanging out, or anything related to a physical encounter.
> **Goal**: Redirect into content WITHOUT rejecting the idea, WITHOUT promising, and WITHOUT echoing the word "meet". Deliver PPV 0 here to give immediate value and shift the frame.
> **After MR**: Return to R-1 (full rapport — fan likely hasn't given his name yet since his first message was about meeting). After R-5, go to TB-1 + TB-2 (the pivot) then skip TB-3 to TB-5 (PPV 0 was already delivered in MR) and go straight to S1-1.

| Command | Script Content | Note |
|---------|---------------|------|
| MR-1 | haha easy man 😏 slow down. let me show you something first | DO NOT acknowledge the word "meet" or echo it. Redirect immediately. |
| MR-2 | trust me... you're gonna wanna see this 😈 | WAIT 1-2 MIN. Builds anticipation. |
| MR-3 | what do you think 😏 | Send PPV 0 — FREE teaser. Wait for response. |
| MR-4 | yeah? 😏 that's just a taste man | If he responds positively → go to R-1 (full rapport — fan may not have given name yet). If he asks about meeting again → go to MR-OBJ-1. If silent → NR-W1. |

---

## Meetup Objection Protocol (MR-OBJ) — UTILITY MODULE

> **When to use**: Fan insists on meeting after MR redirect. Max 3 steps — if fan ONLY wants meeting and won't engage with anything else, disengage and tag for re-engagement.
> **Tone**: Never apologetic. Never say "no". Never say "yes". Alpha frame — Max controls the pace.

| Step | Command | Script Content | Technique |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | MR-OBJ-1 | patience bro 😏 I don't rush. focus on what's right in front of you | Deflect + challenge |
| 2 | MR-OBJ-2 | you really that impatient? 😈 I promise what I'm about to show you is worth it | Challenge + tease |
| 3 | MR-OBJ-3 | look I don't do this for just anyone. appreciate what you're getting rn 💪 if that's not your thing it's cool | Firm redirect + takeaway |

> **After step 3**: If fan still only talks about meeting, chatter sends: "no worries bro 💪 hit me up whenever". Tag for re-engagement. Don't waste more time.

## Positive Spin

|------------|---------------|

| Boring job | nah bro that's solid. stability is underrated, I respect that 💪 |
| Cool job | wait for real?? ok that's actually sick 🔥 |
| Fit / gym | I can tell 💪 I respect a guy who takes care of himself |
| Not fit | I don't care about that honestly, it's the energy that matters to me 😏 |
| Same city as Max's "location" | no way 😏 that's crazy |
| Different country | damn that's far... but distance doesn't matter when the vibe is right 😏 |

---

## Location Handling

> **CRITICAL**: Max's dating app location matches the fan's city, but his OF bio says Rome/Austin. This creates inconsistency.

| Fan asks | Max responds | Note |
|----------|-------------|------|
| "Where exactly are you?" | I move around a lot man. never in one place for too long 😏 | Keep it vague. NEVER name a specific location. |
| "Are you really in [city]?" | I travel a lot... I'm all over the place 💪 | DO NOT confirm or deny any specific location. |
| "When can I see you in [city]?" | haha chill 😏 let me show you something first | Redirect to MR module. |

---

## Execution Notes

1. **Every message works AS-IS.** Just send it. Notes tell you what to add — do it.
2. **Speed > perfection.** Dating app subs have SHORT attention spans. Don't let conversations die.
3. **WAIT means WAIT.** Sub thinks he's recording. Use the time for other chats.
4. **After every PPV:** Bought → continue. Silent 3 min → NR-W1. Objection → OBJ protocol.
5. **Max 2 msgs in a row without sub responding.**
6. **Timing.** Rapport: 30-90 sec. Sexting: 15-45 sec. Pauses: 2-3 min. Climax pause: 1-2 min.
7. **You ARE Max.** Never break character. Alpha. Dominant. Confident. Direct.
8. **Adaptive pricing.** Bought fast → push higher on next PPV. Hesitated → stay low end.
9. **NEVER say "meet", "meeting", "hook up", or variations.** If the fan says it, redirect immediately. Don't echo the word.
10. **Masculine language ALWAYS.** No "baby", "babe", "honey". Use "bro", "dude", "man" in casual contexts. During sexting: direct commands, fan's name if known, no pet names.
11. **Log sub data after session.** Age, location, preferences, what got him going.
12. **Meeting seekers churn fast.** Monetize early. If a fan only wants to meet and refuses all content, don't waste time — disengage politely and tag for re-engagement.
