# Chatting School — Training System

## Project
- Repo: `CW-ChattingSchool`
- Hosted: GitHub Pages (chattingwizard.github.io)
- Tech: Remotion (React video generation) + ElevenLabs TTS
- Quality target: 7/10 (professional corporate explainer)
- Reference channel: EverythingProfessor

## Training Structure (5 Days)

```
Pre-training (recruit's time): Self-study on Chatting School + screening test. 24-48h.
Day 0: Interview (15 min, simplified)
Day 1: Infloww + Scripts + Model Persona (hands-on) — 2-3 hrs
Day 2: Journey step-by-step + annotated chats + practice — 2-3 hrs
Day 3: Advanced skills + objections drill + full simulation — 3 hrs
Day 4: Written quiz (80% pass) + live chatting exam (3.5/5 avg) — 1-2 hrs
Then: 14 days structured probation
```

- Self-study is MANDATORY before Mileh invests time
- Screening test filters before live training
- Organized by SECTIONS (Foundations, Tools, Journey, Advanced, Go Live) NOT by day numbers

## Content Strategy
- One concept = one video. Duration: 45s to 3 min (NOT rigid 1-minute)
- Structure per video: Theory → Practical Example → Recall Question (10 sec at end)
- Text on web = cheat sheet reference (3-5 bullets), NOT learning source
- Video = primary learning tool
- OF jargon (PPV, scripts, sexting, NR) must be TAUGHT with simple analogies
- Planned repetition: each concept appears at least 3 times (intro, context use, review quiz)
- Examples must be LITERAL, not abstract

## Module Structure (Per Section)
1. Micro-video (theory) — 1-3 min
2. Micro-video (example) — 30s-1.5 min
3. Mini-quiz — 30s-1 min
4. Cheat sheet — 3-5 bullets
5. End of section: Chat Simulator (5-10 min) + Scenario Cards (3-5 min)

## Video Inventory (38 micro-videos)
- Foundations (F): 9 videos (F-01 to F-09)
- Tools & Scripts (T): 12 videos (T-01 to T-12)
- The Journey (J): 10 videos (J-01 to J-10)
- Advanced (A): 7 videos (A-01 to A-07)
- Go Live (G): 0 videos (all interactive/live)
- Total narration: ~68 min, ~56,000 characters for ElevenLabs

## Interactive Exercises
- **Mini-quiz**: 2-3 multiple choice after each video, instant feedback
- **Chat Simulator**: Simulates Infloww-like interface. Fan messages → choose action → feedback. THE killer feature.
- **Scenario Cards**: Situation → click to reveal → correct answer

## Video Production Design System
- Background: warm paper tone (#f7f3eb) with grid lines, NOT white/blue
- Minimum 2 visual elements per scene
- 10 component types: ComparisonPanel, FlowDiagram, StepProgression, ChatMockup, StatHighlight, IconGrid, QuoteMantra, Checklist, HierarchyTree, NumberCircle
- 5 layouts: split, stack, grid-2x2, hero-center, timeline
- Automated QA pre-render: validates visual elements, duration, terms defined, example present

## Interview Structure (Updated)
- Removed: formal intro, logistics check, English assessment
- Kept: "Tell me about yourself" (3 min), Motivation Check (3 min), Knowledge Check (7 min), Quick Writing Test (2 min)
- Pass: motivated, knowledge correct, B1+ English + personality in writing
- Fail: can't answer basics, poor English, unclear motivation, red flags

## Key Teaching Concepts
- Script commands use `/` (forward slash), NOT `\`
- "Unread" tab is Step 0 of every shift checklist
- Before each training group: verify training model has ALL current scripts
- Annotated Chat Examples: sourced from real Infloww conversations, prepared by senior TL (one-time task)
