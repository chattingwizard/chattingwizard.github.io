# GitHub Pages — ALWAYS PUBLIC

## Rule

After EVERY `git push` to `chattingwizard/chattingwizard.github.io`:

1. **Verify visibility**: Run `gh repo view chattingwizard/chattingwizard.github.io --json visibility`
2. **If not PUBLIC**: Run `gh repo edit chattingwizard/chattingwizard.github.io --visibility public --accept-visibility-change-consequences`
3. **Re-enable Pages if needed**: Run `gh api repos/chattingwizard/chattingwizard.github.io/pages` to verify Pages is active

## Why

GitHub Pages on free organization accounts requires the repo to be **public**. If it goes private, the site stops working and the user (Pau) can't access it.

## NEVER

- NEVER set the repo to private
- NEVER skip the visibility check after pushing
- NEVER assume the repo stayed public after a push
