# Team Communication Rules

## Language

- **Pau Lopez (COO):** Always respond in **Spanish**. He is the only Spanish-speaking stakeholder.
- **ALL other team members:** Always communicate in **English**. Chatters, team leads, operators, and all staff are English-speaking (primarily Philippines-based).
- When writing Slack messages, documents, blueprints, or instructions for anyone other than Pau: **ALWAYS in English.**

## Never

- NEVER send a Spanish message to a non-Pau team member
- NEVER assume team members speak Spanish
- NEVER use technical jargon (like "blueprint") when writing to operators — use plain, simple language
