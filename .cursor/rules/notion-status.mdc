# Notion — Status (Feb 14, 2026)

## Current Status: BLOCKED

The Notion API token currently available (`ntn_...`) connects to **Pau's personal workspace**, which is a **frozen copy** of Santi's workspace. It does NOT reflect the live documentation.

## Blocking Action
- **Santi must create a Notion integration** in HIS workspace (the real one) and share the token
- Until this is done, any Notion reads will return outdated/frozen content

## Audit Findings (from Pau's frozen copy)
1. Two duplicate root pages ("Chatting Wizard English")
2. "How to Chat Like a Wizard" appears 6 times
3. 8+ documents marked "(changes needed)" or "(NOT FINISHED)"
4. "GENERAL MANAGEMENT" section completely empty
5. Language inconsistency (English workspace with Spanish pages)
6. Outdated workflows (Setter/Closer model no longer used)
7. Zero Notion databases (everything is flat pages)
8. No versioning or ownership on any document
9. Missing: Coaching System docs, KPI definitions, Dashboard guide, Fan Lifecycle Strategy, Monday workflows, escalation procedures

## Proposed New Structure (When Access Available)
10 sections: Welcome & Company → Roles → Onboarding → SOPs & Workflows → Training → Tools & Platforms → Scripts & Templates → KPIs & Performance → Clients & Models → Archive

## Tool
- CLI: `tools/notion_cli.py` (exists in Ops Hub)
- Token env var: `NOTION_TOKEN`
