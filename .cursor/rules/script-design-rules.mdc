# Script Design Rules — Chatting Wizard

## Aftercare Rule (CRITICAL)
- NEVER close the conversation in aftercare. No goodbyes, no "I need to sleep."
- Aftercare = deepen connection, build GFE experience. Chatter stays warm and girlfriend/boyfriend-like.
- Re-engagement messages only kick in if things die naturally or the next day.
- Applies to ALL models, ALL scripts.

## Objection Handling — 3 Categories

### A. OBJECTION HANDLING (PPV/payment resistance)
Fan doesn't want to buy:
- OBJ-PRICE — "That's too expensive"
- OBJ-DISCOUNT — "Can I get a discount?"
- OBJ-FREE — "Send it for free"
- OBJ-NOMONEY — "I don't have money"
- OBJ-NOPPV — "I don't buy PPVs" (identity-based, not price)
- OBJ-CARD — "My card doesn't work"
- OBJ-IGNORE — Fan ignores PPV entirely

### B. RESISTANCE HANDLING (flow/direction resistance)
Fan resists where the conversation is going:
- RES-NOSEX — "I don't want to sext"
- RES-OFFTOPIC — Goes off topic
- RES-REAL — "Can we meet in real life?"
- RES-VOICE — "Send me a voice note / video call"
- RES-CUSTOM-YES / RES-CUSTOM-NO — Custom content response
- RES-DONE — "I already came" / post-climax

### C. SITUATIONAL SCRIPTS (specific moments)
- SIT-CUM — Fan is climaxing
- SIT-DICKPIC — Fan sends dick pic (huge sales opportunity)
- SIT-HORNY — Fan is already excited

## Branch Rules After Every PPV Drop
3 possible outcomes:
1. **Fan BOUGHT** → continue sequence
2. **Fan SILENT (3+ min)** → NR Wave system (max 5 waves: playful nudge → curiosity hook → emotional pull → scarcity → final attempt). After wave 5 = stop.
3. **Fan OBJECTS** → Route to appropriate OBJ script

## Persuasion Psychology (Governs ALL OBJ Handling)
1. Never argue, always redirect
2. Loss aversion > Gain framing (2x stronger)
3. Ego is the most powerful lever ("I thought you were different")
4. Reciprocity creates obligation ("I spent 10 min recording this FOR YOU")
5. Commitment + consistency ("You've come this far...")
6. Always alternate positive/negative — never 3 negatives in a row
7. Every "no" is information about the real resistance type

## Script Personalization (4 Key Moments)
1. **Rapport** — reference model's life/hobbies
2. **Teasing Bridge pivot** — physical context connected to THEIR life
3. **Pre-PPV** — what they do for the fan is special because of who THEY are
4. **Aftercare** — return to the "real person"
- **Spot-check test:** read a message out of context — can you tell which model? If not, too generic.

## Note Types in Script UIs
| Icon | Type | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| ✏️ | EDIT | Chatter must modify before sending |
| ⏳ | WAIT | Stop, wait for fan response |
| 🤖 | AUTO | System handles, chatter does nothing |
| 💡 | TIP | Context/strategy FYI |

## Infloww: Scripts vs Sequences
- **Script** = single standalone message, chatter picks manually
- **Sequence** = chain of scripts, first triggers auto-queue of next
- Rule of thumb: If chatter needs to READ response → standalone. If 2+ messages regardless of response → sequence.
- Journey (R → TB → S → AC) = ONE sequence
- OBJ handling = standalone scripts (chatter evaluates response)

## TPDs Selling Method (Custom Content)
- T = Teasing (build excitement first)
- P = Price (drop price while fan is excited)
- Ds = Distraction Shift (immediately ask a question to redirect attention from price)
- ALWAYS collect payment BEFORE making the custom

## Dating App Traffic — Meetup Redirect Module
- TOS rule: NEVER say "meet", "meeting", "meetup", "hook up" on OF
- Strategy: Never reject meetup idea, never promise, never echo the word. Redirect immediately.
- After MR → shortened rapport (R-3) → skip TB → straight to S1 (sexting)
- Meetup Objection Protocol: Max 3 steps, then disengage. Alpha frame.

## Male Creator Script Rules
- 11 live male creators. Target: gay male fans
- Tone: masculine, alpha, confident — NOT feminine GFE
- Pet names: "bro", "dude", "man" — NEVER "baby", "babe", "honey"
- During sexting: direct commands, fan's actual name, no pet names
- Emojis: masculine (😏🥵💪🔥), NOT (💕🥰🙈)
- Dynamic: hot guy in control, fan is the pursuer

## Fan Priority Order (Inbox Queue)
1. Active sexting (mid-sale)
2. New subscribers (first 48h)
3. Whales (big spenders)
4. Past spenders
5. Time wasters (lowest)
